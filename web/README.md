## Looking for password file 

- The challenge url looks like this: `http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10075/?page=lorem.php`
- Replace `lorem.php` with `/etc/passwd` for the flag.

## Headache

- The flag is in the request headers.

## Words mean something? 

- Change the flag cookie from 0 to 1, and refresh to see the flag.
